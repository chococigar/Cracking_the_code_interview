Q :
Describe how a hash table works.

A :


So if an index is already filled, we can add it to the next empty spot.


Hash : Distribute keys/values across array of buckets.
Hash function : Any function that is used to map a data set of arbitrary size to a data set of fixed size (under the hash table).
**
hash = hashfunc(key)
index = hash % array_size
**

Hashing is used when keys are large, and can't directly be used as index.
Large keys are converted into small numbers using hash functions.


Good hashing : 1. easy computation / 2. uniform distribution / 3. less collision

Dict is also part of a hash table where indices are "strings" (in which we're required to read the string index)

Reference : time complexity between arrays and hash tables
