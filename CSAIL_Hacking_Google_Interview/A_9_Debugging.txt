Q : Describe a good strategy to find a bug in a program.


Debugging is just like searching for an element within a tree.
Analyze the program into segments by functions/goals.
print values, etc.
See if it can be scoped to one segment.
Once you are in a smaller scope, more fine-testing can work
(try different routes, etc)

Key is to limit the scope of search.
