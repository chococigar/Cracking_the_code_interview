Q : Describe an algorithm to output a die roll (a random number from 1 to 6), given a  function that outputs a coin toss (a random number from 1 to 2).  Each possible  outcome should be equally likely.

A :
1 : 1, 2
2 : 2, 3, 4
3 : 3, 4, 5, 6
4 : 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
5 : 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Addition.

f(die_roll) = (sum of 5 f(coin_toss)) - 4.

ANOTHER A:
flip coin 3 times, bitwise. Otherwise, repeat.
