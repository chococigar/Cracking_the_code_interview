Q :
Describe a technique to identify a "leader" among a group of 10 identical servers  that are all connected to every other server.  There are no prior distinguishing  characteristics of any of them and the same program to identify the leader starts  running on all of them at the same time.  After an answer is given, ask how much  network traffic it requires and, if "ties" are possible, ask how you can break ties.
