Q : Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings,
sorted each string, and the sorted the full array.
What would the runtime be?

A :

given m = length of largest string
      n = length of the array

to sort one string : m*log(m)
to sort all of the strings in the array : n*m*log(m)

to sort all of the elements of array : n*log(n) * m
where m is taken to compare between the two string elements

thus n*m*log(m) + n*m*log(n) = n*m (log(n) + log(m))

thus time complexity is O(n*m (log(n) + log(m)))
